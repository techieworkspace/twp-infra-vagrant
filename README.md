# TWP Microservice

## Overview

This microservice is part of the **TWP (Techie WorkPractice)** initiative â€” a series of hands-on design and coding bootcamp programs by [Techie Workspace](https://www.techieworkspace.com).  
TWP helps learners build real-world microservices from scratch while gaining practical experience in version control, DevOps workflows, containerization, and scalable architecture patterns.

Each service in the TWP ecosystem is independently developed and deployable, following microservice best practices.
